# Example Consolidation Plan

Current examples can be grouped into categories:

1. Basic Connection
- simple_connection.jl
- test_ws_minimal.jl
-> Consolidate into one basic connection example

2. Page Operations
- navigation_basic.jl
- content_basic.jl
- screenshot_basic.jl
- evaluate_basic.jl
-> Consolidate into one comprehensive page operations example

3. Element Interactions
- element_basic.jl
- form_basic.jl
-> Consolidate into one element interaction example

4. WebSocket/CDP Testing
- cdp_websocket_test.jl
- test_websocket_channels.jl
- test_ws_connection.jl
- websocket_test.jl
-> Remove these as they're more for development testing

5. Core Demo
- minimal_core_demo.jl
-> Keep this as a comprehensive example

Proposed Final Examples (5):
1. basic_connection.jl - Simple browser connection and cleanup
2. page_operations.jl - Navigation, content, screenshots, and JavaScript evaluation
3. element_interactions.jl - Element finding, clicking, form filling
4. form_automation.jl - Complex form handling with various input types
5. comprehensive_demo.jl - Full featured demo showing multiple features together

Next step will be to create and test these consolidated examples.
